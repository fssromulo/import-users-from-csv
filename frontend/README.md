## Enhacements

I wasn't able to create tests good enough. I don't have large experience with tests. I do wrote tests once but It was in frontend and the tests suite was already build and I performe some changes, fix and create other based it the another tests.

So I prefer be honest and write very basics tests to cover your requirements.
